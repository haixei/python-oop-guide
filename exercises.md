# Exercises

This file is meant to be a list of exercises published in the OOP in Python series. They are divided per article and all the answers to them can be found in this repository. If you want to see an answer simply navigate to a folder with the correct article number (ex. OOP 1 is the first article) and then find your Python file with the exercise name you are looking for. Every folder is divided into three subsections, "Article's code" that refers to examples in the article,  "Article's code (logic only)" that contains the same information (sometimes a bit shorter) written without any practical example (letters only) and "Exercises" where you can find all the answers to the tasks.



- **OOP 1**
  - _Birds_ - Practice creating a simple class architecture by creating a Bird class. Give the birds colors, names and sounds. Create a method called "introduce" that will introduce the bird and another one called "sound" that will return the sound it makes.
  - _Car Lock_ - Add a new method to the Car class (inheritance_cars.py in the repository, article's code). Add a new attribute to the car called "locked". and create a method called "change_lock" to switch the value to the opposite of itself every time you use it. Create a new object with the value of locked set to True (Boolean) and use your method to unlock the car.
  - _Assistant_ - Create a different class called Assistant that will imitate assistants like Alexa or Siri. Give it attributes called "name" and "version". Make a static attribute called "latest_os_version" and set it to 12. Create a method that upgrades the device to the latest version if the version is too low. Also, create a method called "return_time" that will return time only if the "version" attribute is equal to 11 or bigger. If the version is too low, return a string containing information that the user should update the device.
- **OOP 2**
