# Python OOP guide
Basic to advanced OOP concepts in Python taught by articles and exercises. Below you can find the legend for all the topics covered in the series of posts. This repository consists of only the code embedded in the posts and answers to exercises mentioned in them. You can find more in-depth information about Python's OOP in their [official documentation.](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

Remember that practice makes perfect. After each section of the article, it is good to do some exercises. Usually the article will include them under the section but you can also find them in the [exercises.md](/exercises.md) file. They are grouped by the article number and their answers can be found in an appropriate folder.
